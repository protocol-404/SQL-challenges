## Products with “queso” in ProductName

### Exercice:

In the products table, we’d like to see the ProductID and ProductName for those products where the ProductName includes the string “queso”.

### Expected Results:

| ProductID | ProductName                |
| --------- | -------------------------- |
| 11        | Queso Cabrales             |
| 12        | Queso Manchego La Pastora |

(2 row(s) affected)

### Hint:

In an earlierproblem, we were looking for exact matches — where our filter matched the value in the field exactly. Here, we’re looking for rows where the ProductName field has the value “queso” somewhere in it.
Use the “like” operator, with wildcards, in the answer. Feel free to do some research online to find examples.
