## Sales Representatives in the United States

### Exercice:

Now we’d like to see the same columns as above, but only for those employees that both have the title of Sales Representative, and also are in the United States.

### Expected Results:

| FirstName        | LastName      | HireDate                |
|------------------|---------------|-------------------------|
| Nancy            | Davolio       | 2010-05-01 00:00:00.000 |
| Janet            | Leverling     | 2010-04-01 00:00:00.000 |
| Margaret         | Peacock       | 2011-05-03 00:00:00.000 |

### Hint:

To apply multiple filters in a where clause, use “and” to separate the filters.
