## Orders shipping to any country in Latin America

### Exercice:

Now, instead of just wanting to return all the orders from France of Belgium, we want to show all the orders from any Latin American country. But we don’t have a list of Latin American countries in a table in the Northwind database. So, we’re going to just use this list of Latin American countries that happen to be in the Orders table:
Brazil
Mexico
Argentina
Venezuela
It doesn’t make sense to use multiple Or statements anymore, it would get too convoluted. Use the In statement.

### Expected Results:

|---------|------------|-------------|
| 10250   | HANAR      | Brazil      |
| 10253   | HANAR      | Brazil      |

### Hint

Here’s an example of the previous questions, about orders shipping to France or Belgium, done as an In statement instead of using multiple Where clauses.
```sql
SELECT
    OrderID,
    CustomerID,
    OrderDate,
    ShipCountry
FROM
    Orders
WHERE
    ShipCountry IN ('France','Belgium')
```
