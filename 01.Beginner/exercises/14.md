## How many customers?

### Exercice:

 How many customers do we have in the Customers table? Show one value only, and don’t rely on getting the recordcount at the end of a resultset.

 ### Expected Results:

| TotalCustomers |
| -------------- |
|       91       |

(1 row(s) affected)

### Hint

In order to get the total number of customers, we need to use what’s called an aggregate function. Look online for an aggregate function that would work for this problem.
