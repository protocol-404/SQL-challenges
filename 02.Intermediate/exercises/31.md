## Customers with no orders for EmployeeID 4

### Exercice:

One employee (Margaret Peacock, EmployeeID 4) has placed the most orders. However, there are some customers who've never placed an order with her. Show only those customers who have never placed an order with her.

### Expected Results:

| CustomerID | CustomerID |
|------------|------------|
| SEVES      | NULL       |
| THEBI      | NULL       |
| LAZYK      | NULL       |
| GROSR      | NULL       |
| PARIS      | NULL       |

| SPECD      | NULL       |
| LAUGB      | NULL       |
| PRINI      | NULL       |
| VINET      | NULL       |
| FRANR      | NULL       |
| CONSH      | NULL       |
| NORTS      | NULL       |

### Hint

Building on the previous problem, you might think you need to do something like this:

```sql
SELECT
    Customers.CustomerID,
    Orders.CustomerID
FROM
    Customers
LEFT JOIN
    Orders ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID
WHERE
    Orders.CustomerID IS NULL
    AND Orders.EmployeeID = 4;
```
â€¦adding this filter in the where clause: and Orders.EmployeeID = 4
However, this returns no records.
Note that with outer joins, the filters on the where clause are applied after the join
