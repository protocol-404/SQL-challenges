## High freight charges

### Exercice:

Some of the countries we ship to have very high freight charges. We'd like to investigate some more shipping options for our customers, to be able to offer them lower freight charges. Return the three ship countries with the highest average freight overall, in descending order by average freight.

### Expected Results:

| ShipCountry | AverageFreight |
|-------------|----------------|
| Austria     | 184.7875       |
| Ireland     | 145.0126       |
| USA         | 112.8794       |


(3 row(s) affected)

### Hint

We'll be using the Orders table, and using the Freight and ShipCountry fields.

You'll want to group by ShipCountry, and use the Avg function. Don't worry about showing only the top 3 rows until you have the grouping and average freight set up.

You should have something like this:
```sql
SELECT 
    ShipCountry, AverageFreight = AVG(freight)
FROM Orders
GROUP BY ShipCountry
ORDER BY AverageFreight DESC;
```
Now you just need to show just the top 3 rows
