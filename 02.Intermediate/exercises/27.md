## High freight charges with between

### Exercice:

Another (incorrect) answer to the problem above is this:

```sql

SELECT TOP 3
    ShipCountry, AverageFreight = AVG(freight)
FROM Orders
WHERE
    OrderDate BETWEEN '1/1/2015' AND '12/31/2015'
 GROUP BY ShipCountry
 ORDER BY AverageFreight DESC;
 ```
Notice when you run this, it gives Sweden as the ShipCountry with the third highest freight charges. However, this is wrong - it should be France.
What is the OrderID of the order that the (incorrect) answer above is missing?

### Expected Results:

(no expected results this time - we’re looking for a specific OrderID)

### Hint

The Between statement is inclusive. Why isn’t it showing the order made on December 31, 2015?

Run this query, and look at the rows around December 31, 2015. What do you notice? Look specifically at the Freight field.
```sql
SELECT * FROM orders ORDER BY OrderDate
```
