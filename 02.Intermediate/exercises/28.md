## High freight charges - last year

### Exercice:

We're continuing to work on high freight charges. We now want to get the three ship countries with the highest average freight charges.
But instead of filtering for a particular year, we want to use the last 12 months of order data, using as the end date the last OrderDate in Orders

### Expected Results:

| ShipCountry | AverageFreight |
|-------------|----------------|
| Ireland     | 200.21         |
| Austria     | 186.4596       |
| USA         | 119.3032       |

(3 row(s) affected)

### Hint

First, get the last OrderDate in Orders. Write a simple select statement to get the highest value in the OrderDate field using the Max aggregate function.

You should have something like this:
```sql
 SELECT MAX(OrderDate) FROM Orders
 ```
Now you need to get the date 1 year before the last order date. Create a simple select statement that subtracts 1 year from the last order date.
You can use the DateAdd function for this. Note that within DateAdd, you can use the subquery you created above. Look online for som examples if you need to.

You should have something like this:
```sql
SELECT DATEADD(yy, -1, (SELECT MAX(OrderDate) FROM Orders))
```
Now you just need to put it in the where clause.
