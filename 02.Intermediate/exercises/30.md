## Customers with no orders

### Exercice:

There are some customers who have never actually placed an order.
Show these customers.

### Expected Results:

| Customers_CustomerID | Orders_CustomerID |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| FISSA                | NULL              |
| PARIS                | NULL              |



(2 row(s) affected)

### Hint

One way of doing this is to use a left join, also known as a left outer join.

```sql
SELECT
    Customers_CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID,
    Orders_CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID
FROM
    Customers
LEFT JOIN
    Orders
ON
    Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID;
```
This is a good start. It shows all records from the Customers table, and the matching records from the Orders table. However, we only want those records where the CustomerID in Orders is null. You still need a filter
