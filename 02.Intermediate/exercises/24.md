## Customer list by region

### Exercice:

A salesperson for Northwind is going on a business trip to visit customers, and would like to see a list of all customers, sorted by region, alphabetically.
However, he wants the customers with no region (null in the Region field) to be at the end, instead of at the top, where you’d normally find the null values. Within the same region, companies should be sorted by CustomerID.

### Expected Results:

### Hint

You won’t be able to sort directly on the Region field here. You’ll need to sort on the Region field, and also on a computed field that you create, which will give you a secondary sort for when Region is null.
First, without ordering, create a computed field that has a value which will sort the way you want. In this case, you can create a field with the Case statement, which allows you do to if/then logic. You want a field that is 1 when Region is null.
Take a look at the Examples section in the SQL Server documentation for Case [https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms181765.aspx#examples](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms181765.aspx#examples).
Note that when filtering for null values, you can't use "FieldName = Null". You must use “FieldName is null”


You should have something like this:
```sql
SELECT
    CustomerID, CompanyName, Region
Case  
    when Region is null then 1
    else 0
End
From Customers
```
When the Region contains a null, you will have a 1 in the final column.
Now, just add the fields for the Order By clause, in the right order.
