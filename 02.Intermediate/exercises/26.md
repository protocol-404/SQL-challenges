## High freight charges - 2015

### Exercice:

We're continuing on the question above on high freight charges. Now, instead of using all the orders we have, we only want to see orders from the year 2015.

### Expected Results:

| ShipCountry   | AverageFreight |
|---------------|----------------|
| Austria       | 178.3642       |
| Switzerland   | 117.1775       |
| France        | 113.991        |

(3 row(s) affected)

### Hint

You need to add a Where clause to the query from the previous problem.
The field to filter on is OrderDate.

When filtering on dates, you need to know whether the date field is a DateTime, or a Date field. Is OrderDate a Datetime or a Date field?
